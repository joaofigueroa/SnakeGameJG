# SnakeGameJG

This is a very simple game made to the selection process of the emerging EdTech Startup Jovens Genios from Rio de Janeiro. 
Please note that this game was heavily inspired in a github repository that can be found on the following link: https://github.com/sgoedecke/socket-io-game. Take the time to analyse the similarites and differences between the two codes. 

This project uses node.js, express.js and socket.io. In the front-end, some basic bootstrap is used, as well as some Google fonts.

To run this project in your environment you'll need node and npm to be installed. then, go to the folder where you can find the package.json and run npm install. Now that you have all the dependencies installed simply run npm start, go to the browser of your preference and go to localhost:8080/ 

Have fun! (:
